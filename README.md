MEDICAL DATA VISUALIZER

This project analyzes patient data from a medical examination CSV file to generate insightful visualizations. 
It includes:

   •    A categorical plot that shows the distribution of health-related features (like cholesterol, 
        smoking habits, and activity level) split by the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.

   •    A heatmap that reveals correlations between medical metrics such as blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, and more.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering (like calculating BMI-based overweight status), 
and visual storytelling using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
